# Simple but minimal Portfolio Website
  
Hi everyone, my name is Devang Saklani. I'm a Front-end Developer from India and I've recently built a *Simple portfolio website*  using React and GSAP.
Everyone can use this website and modify it in which ever way they want (no attributions necessary).

Particle JS is also now integrated in a clone of this project ðŸ¤© and it is looking really good:

I've also added few default themes but You can also make and add your own theme by making a simple CSS Class like:

```CSS
.unique_theme {
	--bg: #0c0f0a;
	--primary: #f8f8f8;
	--secondary: #d1d1d1;
	--highlight: #41ead4;
	--card: #ffffff08;
	--icon-bg: #9e6e6e1a;
	--icon-bg-hover: #ffffff1c;
}
```

and then add this Class to ` <body>` tag in `index.html`.

## How to change themes

To change themes go to ` index.html ` file and change the class of body tag to the theme name like:

```

or

```html
<body  class="dark">
```
